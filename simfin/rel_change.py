    Calculate the relative change for the values in a Pandas DataFrame or
    Series with either a DatetimeIndex or MultiIndex.

    This can be used to calculate growth-rates e.g. Sales and Earnings Growth,
    as well as stock-returns. It can be calculated for any time-interval that
    is a multiple of the DataFrame's frequency.

    The number of days, weeks, months, quarters and years is combined into
    an integer `periods` for the number of time-steps to shift the DataFrame,
    depending on the DataFrame's frequency. The relative change is calculated
    from the original and shifted DataFrame.

    If `annualized==False` then the function calculates the following:

    - If `future==True` then `df_result[t] = df[t+periods] / df[t] - 1`
    - If `future==False` then `df_result[t] = df[t] / df[t-periods] - 1`

    If `annualized==True` then the function calculates the annualized change
    instead, which is particularly useful when the time-interval is several
    years. For example, this can be used to calculate the Annualized Total
    Return on stocks. The variable `shifted_years` is the number of years
    corresponding to `periods`. So the function calculates:

    - If `future==True` then
      `df_result[t] = (df[t+periods] / df[t]) ** (1 / shifted_years) - 1`
    - If `future==False` then
      `df_result[t] = (df[t] / df[t-periods]) ** (1 / shifted_years) - 1`

    See `Tutorial 03`_ for detailed examples on how to use this function.

    This function can take a while to compute, so it will create a cache-file
    if you pass the arg `cache_refresh`. The next time you call this function,
    the cache-file will get loaded if it is more recent than specified by
    `cache_refresh`, otherwise the function will get computed again and the
    result saved in the cache-file for future use. See the documentation for
    the :obj:`~simfin.cache.cache` function for details on its arguments.

    .. warning:: You **MUST** use keyword arguments to this function, otherwise
        the first unnamed arguments would get passed to the `cache` wrapper
        instead.

    :param df:
        Pandas DataFrame or Series assumed to have either a DatetimeIndex
        or a MultiIndex with 2 indices, one of which is a DatetimeIndex
        and the other is given by the arg `group_index`.

        .. warning:: `df` is assumed to be sorted in ascending order on its
            date-index. Furthermore, the DataFrame is assumed to be complete
            in the sense that data is present for all time-steps at the given
            frequency. This function does not check that. The SimFin database
            ensures that quarterly and annual financial data such as Income
            Statements are all complete in this sense, but if you are using
            other data-sources, then you must ensure this yourself.

    :param freq:
        String for the frequency of the DataFrame `df`. Valid options:

        - 'bdays' or 'b' for business or trading-days data.
        - 'days' or 'd' for data that has all 7 week-days.
        - 'weeks' or 'w' for weekly data.
        - 'months' or 'm' for monthly data.
        - 'quarters' or 'q' for quarterly data.
        - 'years', 'y', 'annual', 'a' for yearly or annual data.

    :param future:
        Boolean whether to calculate the future change (True)
        or past change (False).

    :param bdays: Number of business or trading-days.
    :param days: Number of days in a 7-day week.
    :param weeks: Number of weeks.
    :param months: Number of months.
    :param quarters: Number of quarters.
    :param years: Number of years.

    :param annualized:
        Boolean whether to calculate the annualized change (True)
        or the relative change (False). When calculating the change over
        several years, it is often useful to calculate the annualized change
        by setting this to True.

    :param new_names:
        Dict or function for mapping / converting the column-names.
        If `df` is a Pandas Series, then this is assumed to be a string.

    :param group_index:
        If `df` has a MultiIndex then group companies using this index-column.
        By default this is TICKER but it could also be e.g. SIMFIN_ID if
        you are using that as an index in your DataFrame.

    Calculate the mean log-change for the values in a Pandas DataFrame or
    Series with either a DatetimeIndex or MultiIndex.

    This is useful e.g. for calculating the mean future stock-returns for
    all periods between e.g. 1 and 3 years so as to smoothen the short-term
    volatility. This can make it easier to see how predictor variables such
    as P/E ratios may relate to future returns.

    This implementation is slightly complicated, but the idea is fairly simple:
    Instead of calculating the relative change between two points `df[t]` and
    `df[t + periods]`, we want to calculate the mean change between a point
    `df[t]` and a whole slice of points `df[t + min_periods:t + max_periods]`.

    We use the logarithm because it makes it easier to implement efficiently
    by using vectorized math operations directly supported in Pandas and Numpy.
    But using the logarithm also means that negative values are not supported.

    We use the natural logarithm, which is almost linear for changes between
    Â±20%, but beyond that range it underestimates both the gains and losses
    compared to the non-log changes. For practical purposes, you may often
    consider the mean-log changes to be roughly equivalent to the normal
    percentage changes.

    used in this function, and examples on how to use this function.

        Boolean whether to calculate the annualized change (True),
        or the geometric mean for the original frequency of the data (False).
        For example, if you want to calculate the change over several years,
        it is often useful to calculate the annualized change by setting this
        to True. But if you want to calculate the change over shorter periods
        e.g. days or weeks, then the annualized change may result in extreme
        values. If you set this to False then the geometric mean is calculated
        in the original frequency of the data, e.g. daily for share-price data
        or quarterly for TTM data.
